# Scientific SQLite

This is a test application combining Flask, SQLite, Uvicorn, FastAPI, WebSocket, and Pydantic together to form one full-stack, feature-complete web application in Python, decked out with settings, databasing, loggging, API endpoints, a frontend page, a schema store, and a content loader system.
